# Key Events
The party arrives at the [[Tower of the Twilight Lotus]] and I meet with them, [[Oka]] in hand. We all go into the tower to speak. I bring forth Oka and show his eyes to [[Dedera]]. We discuss how to handle to the potential rebirth of Oka. 

In an attempt to figure out if he is magical, I recall the events of the journey from Windsend to Blue Crystal Village, focusing on the darkness and werewolves paralysis, claiming that they could have been from me or him. Gretchen chimes in, saying that for the past few days, he has been quite normal.

Antares mentions that the creatures that attacked my carriage are (former) members of the [[Half-Moon Hunters]]. 

Antares brings up his offer for me to join the [[Order of the Twilight Lotus]]. I mention that I would like to join, and give my history as a hunter and infiltrator. While not formal military training, I do want to help accomplish that which is good for future generations. 

[[Eiden]] handed over schematics of an Amber Cure Dispersal System to [[Tanoq]]. 

The party discusses plans on the upcoming civil war with [[Gael]] & [[Ann Gao]].
