# Personas
![[Persona - Cyrus.png]]
A persona that Ashe and Therion use to remember their father and that they use when performing noble acts. 

# Backstory
Ashe came from the small town of Lazuli on the topside of Levasa. Born to the Cyrus Dragonspeaker, Ashe loved hearing the tales of his dad's adventures and the fantastic beings he would meet on his journeys. Cyrus would tell him tales of the mighty dragons that he felled and befriended, telling Ashe where he met them as well, promising to take him to visit them when Ashe turned 16. 

On Ashe's 16th birthday, Seed Cultists attacked his village and killed everyone while he and his brother were out hunting. They were gathering meat for their journey to the dragons. Returning to nothing but rubble, they were stunned, but found their father's gear from when he was an adventurer (Dragon Wing Longbow, Dragon-Touched Focus, Sun Blade & Serpent Scale Mail). They buried their family and swore vengeance on those that that did this. Not able to live up to their last name, they abandoned it, deciding to make their own when the time came. 

While on the way to Windsend, The Raven Queen, unbeknownst to Ashe and Therion, took interest in Ashe and guided him in such a way that they would make it to the city. This help manifested its way via weapons appearing when they were about to be caught by bandits and blending into the shadows in a preternatural way. 

When they got to Windsend, they found it difficult to find work, and soon fell on hard times. The brothers began to frequent the poorhouse of Windsend (First meeting with Ingrid) trying to get anything they could. Therion suddenly fell very ill, and Ashe begged the clerics working the poorhouse to help. They took the brothers to the temple of Chauntea, where a young cleric with auburn hair tended to his brother and nursed him back to health. 

Once he regained his strength, they continued the search for work. One night, while sleeping on the streets, Arkos bullied them and said that they were useless. Only when they began to fight back did he mention that he could use such energy and offered them the community of the Gulls. Therion declined for them, but Ashe didn't agree. Ashe argued that they could make a living in The Gulls, especially with their abilities, but Therion told him that honor is more important than gold. 

Therion found work as leathersmith, using a persona named Alfyn. It didn't bring home a lot of gold, but did bring home enough for Therion to give them food on the table, and shelter over their heads. Feeling like he could make more money to raise their standard of living, Ashe secretly reached out to Arkos, requesting to join The Gulls. He spun a story of an apprenticeship he had found to Therion so that his absences throughout the day and night were not questioned. After joining, Ashe did a few jobs for them, and saved his money, hoping to surprise Therion with enough to help get a better home. 

The Gulls never knew that Ashe was a changeling since he used a persona named Oberron, so that his abilities stayed secret. 

Occasionally, he would go to the Silver Songbird, and one day a dwarven bard performing spun fantastic tales and Ashe was intrigued. 

As the days turned to months, the crimes he committed began to weigh on his conscious. The straw that broke the camel's back was when the Gulls told him to steal a cleric's staff of healing (Ingrid is the cleric here) so they could sell it on the black market. He used his abilities to easily find the target, only the realize that the cleric they wanted the staff from was the same cleric that had saved his brother, out giving food and medicine to the poor. He could not bring himself to complete his mission, since the church had helped him and his brother in the past before the Gulls, so in the dead of night before the heist, he went to Therion, and confessed his transgressions. 

In the same instance that I tell Therion about stealing the staff of healing from Ingrid, he tells me that Arkos and a man named Hammond came into his leather shop to use it for something nefarious or as a cover. They bought nothing of value, but Hammond kept staring at him throughout the conversation he (Hammond) had with Arkos. During the exchange between Hammond and Arkos, Arkos gave Hammond money in exchange for a scroll. Arkos seemed nervous throughout the exchange, mentioning something about his family. At the end of the day, Hammond went to Therion and showed himself to be Ophelia, telling Therion that she knows who and what we are. She said that Arkos is leaving Windsend and doesn't want the Gulls to know, so she's helping smuggle his family out of the city. 

Therion pulls out a scroll and hands it to me. She told him that if I want to go, go to the Wispwine Inn and order mashed potatoes with rosemary. Therion mentions that he met a girl. He claims responsibility for my joining the gang, but I refute it. 

I pack my bags and head out, wishing him luck and hugging him on the way out. 

I go to the Wispwine Inn and find Ophelia. She tell me that Arkos's family has recently adopted a child and they are afraid of living in the Flurries. Arkos went and found Ophelia, knowing that she runs a caravan to Blue Crystal Village. She tasks me to go with the caravan and help guard it with her. She gives me a basic understanding of the Formless Brotherhood. She has suspicions on _who_ we are in addition to what we are. She doesn't know if I'm Formless Brotherhood material, but I do need help and she can provide that. 

The next morning, we meet up and I use the persona my dad used, Cyrus. She says that her persona is Denia. We walk through the Flurries and pick up Arkos's family (2 dwarves and 1 human baby). Seeing that the baby's blanket is a bit worn, I get a nicer one for them. 

We head up to the King's Highway via The Great Bridge. While on the road, the father gives me thanks for the blanket I gave them. He says his name is Aekos Arkosson and her name is Reikos Aekos and the child's name is Aikos Aekosson. 

We are on the road for 4 days, and about 5-6 hours from the village, we take a fork in the road leading down a more private path leading towards a massive opening that has trees and rolling hills. On the other side of this cavern, there is the Tower being built. 

As we get through the woods in the cavern, the horses begin to need more direction and get twitchy. I offer to scout ahead and look for any danger. I slip through the trees with little issue, keeping up with the cart. I see wildlife while travelling, and I notice a group of 4 gruff looking people carrying a lot of pelts with a cart they are pulling manually. They stop and looks like the _smell_ me(?). They comment on it and then suggest they keep going. 

I report back to Ophelia, and she says that they are most likely blood-hunters. I position myself on top of the carriage and get an arrow ready to draw. While at my vantage point, I see red eyes gleaming from the shadows. A large wolf comes charging at us. We are attacked by 2 werewolves and 2 scouts.

Reikos and Aekos are hit by arrows. I heal Reikos and turn to help Aekos, but not entirely able to heal him, he thankfully does survive. 

We enter the encampment surrounding the tower and find more hunters like the ones that attacked us. She points to the flag, the Order of the Twilight Lotus. She's just as confused as I am. We continue through the encampment until we are flagged down by a half-elf young man. The young man is Antares Free. He says that the tower is soon-to-be King Dedera's. Antares inspects the cart, and Ophelia mentions the blood in the cart. 

Antares asks why the horses are spooked and I tell him that were we besieged by bandits. I explain the wounds that Reikos and Aekos have and hand over the bolts that pierced them. 

Antares lets us go through the other side of the encampment, and says that we should be safe. We leave the camp. 

Ophelia tells me that she feels that the Frees are people that you can't be too honest with, Dedera and Antares appearing to be exceptions. 

We continue down the path and make it to Blue Crystal Village. 

Blue Crystal Village has 400-500 people in it and it's build like a donut with a large blue crystal in the middle. We get to a safehouse and this is where Ophelia agreed to drop off Aekos and Reikos. Reikos praises us once we get there. 

Ophelia and I go to the bar and talked about how I joined the Gulls. She says that I have the skills to join the Brotherhood, but not sure if I have the inner strength to join. She tells me that the family we saved don't know what they have. She mentions my father and that she knew of him. She tells me that the group that attacked my village was Seed and that her Brotherhood was created to take them down. She tells me that Lord Free will clash with Seed at some point, and if he's king, then it'll affect all of Levasa. She says that he is on the frontlines and the Brotherhood is in the shadows. Her Brotherhood and Dedera aligned goals.

She says that Aikos isn't what he seems. She says that in the baby's iris are black with a silver line though them. She tells me that the hero of light, Oka, had roman numerals in his eyes. She says that we should capture the baby and bring him to the Tower of the Twilight Lotus, where he will be safe. 

I sneak into the house and, mimicking Aekos, steal away Oka and leave. Returning to Ophelia, she tells me to take a horse and take Oka to the Tower of the Twlight Lotus. She says that I should the brother who isn't always hidden in the shadows. She wants me to join with Dedera and tell him about Oka residing in his tower. 

We decide that my codename in the brotherhood is Garlic. She renames me Ashe Garlic Veilshifter. 

I take Oka to the Tower and show him to Antares. Antares says that word needs to be sent to Dedera immediately and that I have to stay with the child since they aren't equipped to take care of him.

# Old Backstory

He told Therion of The Gulls and that he had made a mistake by joining them. He wanted out, but was scared of retaliation. Therion asked him which persona he used and changed himself into Oberron, "Let me protect you. I'll take your place, but you have to leave Windsend. Go to Heartbeat and ask for Ophelia. She had family in our village and I've been in contact with her. Until I'm able to leave as well, stay there and stay out of trouble." They hugged for the last time, Ashe crying and asking for forgiveness. Therion sent him on his way, going out to the meeting spot and stealing the staff. Ashe took the gold he had saved and travelled the King's Road, making sure to follow his brother's orders. 

Once he got to Heartbeat, he met up with Ophelia, Therion's contact. Unknown to Therion, Ophelia is the leader of The Formless Brotherhood an organization of spies for hire. While there, she sent him on a mission, and upon completion, she bestowed him the code name Veilshifter. 

While he went about his duties for Ophelia, occasionally he would hear voices in his head, revealing secrets of the shadows and how to enhance his abilities magically. 

After some time, Ophelia revealed to him what she knew about the Razing of Lazuli. The Cult of Seed was behind the attack, but she doesn't know why. She tells him that won't fully initiate Ashe into the Formless Brotherhood due to how young he is, but that his skills are undoubtedly impressive for his age. If he can continue to keep tabs on Seed, perhaps she'll reconsider her decision. 

She tells him that she heard of a group that is currently in Heartbeat and has had confrontations with Seed before. She also mentions that the Future King is with them, and that if Ashe can join them, then maybe he can get closer to understanding Seed and their motives. Ashe sees this as an amazing opportunity for 3 of his goals:
1) He can impress Ophelia
2) He can enact revenge on Seed
3) Potentially help his brother out of The Gulls by having the Future King assist him in leaving.
