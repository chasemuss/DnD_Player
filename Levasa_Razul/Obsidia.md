## #Dnd/Levasa/Session/2021_11_19 - **Fighting in the Mines**
A small mining village, it was plagued by shadow creatures that they thought were caused by the young witch [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Lyserah]]. When the locals went on their way to kill her, the [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/_Levasa#Player Characters|Party]] came in and stopped them, saving her.

We went into the local mine and found [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane#Cult of Seed|Cultists of Seed]] performing a ritual to summon a fire elemental. 

After disposing of the cultists and their elemental, we met a character named [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Lorenzo]]. 

[[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]]'s imp found a note that says "Eradicate the dwarves and collect the Amber in Obsidia's Mine"

## #DnD/Levasa/Session/2021_11_26 - **Delving Deeper into the Mines**
As we traversed deeper into the mine, we came across a door that had a note saying "Don't open, shadows inside". As we get closer, hot oil begins to come from atop it. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]] learns there are thralls of [[Levasa/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] ahead. He scouts with his imp and sees that there are hell hounds carrying dwarf bodies to feed an abomination. 

After destroying the door with the shield guardian too well, [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Razul Dazulson|I]] _webbed_ it to be more secure. 

After a quick assessment of our situation, we decided the best course of action is to bring the ceiling down on these creatures. There were two paths, straight and right. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Tanoq]] and I went straight and [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Ingrid Epensen|Ingrid]] and [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Dedera Free|Dedera]] went right. The creatures began to attack [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Ingrid Epensen|Ingrid]] & [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Dedera Free|Dedera]], so they fought them off. 

[[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Tanoq]] then shot a _fireball_ centered on a room full of alcohol, causing an explosion. I then cast _Pulse Wave_, knocking out what pillars remained. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Ingrid Epensen|Ingrid]] then shot _guided bolts_ at the pillars to the right, bringing them down, but breaking her ankle escaping the collapse. 

We decided to rest up, and [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]] sent his imp into the rubble to check for survivors. Only the abomination was alive. He tells the imp that [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Lyserah]] serves "The Cat"

Some local miners came by and saw that we had caused the cave in. Understandably, they were distraught, but they go to [[Gecko]] to talk with him about it. 

It was here that [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]] told us about a coin he has on which contracts can be made, but if the person he makes the contract with breaks their oath, he gets to cage their soul to either interrogate it or heal himself. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Lyserah]] is bound by the coin to be his apprentice. 

## #DnD/Levasa/Session/2021_12_03 - **Actions have Consequences**
We leave the mine and go to Gecko's Inn to explain what happened. He said that we'd have to pay and it was decided that the town would relocate at the cost of the crown (15k GP). We also learned that the amber miners in Obsidia work for Scale.

After the talk with Gecko, the party had a long talk about the morality of our actions and whether or not we could've taken the demons in the mines. We also discussed [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]]'s Contract Coin and the ethics of it, enchantment magic, and divination magic that invades privacy. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Lyserah]] mentions that were it up to her, she wouldn't have put her soul up as collateral in the Coin. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]], [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Dedera Free|Dedera]], and I formed the following contract:

```ad-abstract
title: Magicks Contract
collapse: open

1) Azazel's Coin won't be used unless it is to protect someone's life, liberty, or property
2) Razul's Enchantment Spells won't be used unless it is to protect someone's life, liberty, or property
3) [[Dedera Free|Dedera]]'s Helm of Detect Thoughts won't be used unless it is to protect someone's life, liberty, or property
```

With that, we took a long rest and woke up to Kat telling us the following: "Gecko told the miners at the height of the drinking what happened and had to do what he could to stop them from killing us. Most of them will most likely not want to transplant to another city, and will stay here. There are some reasonable ones that will transplant, but it's unlikely."

## #DnD/Levasa/Session/2021_12_10 - **Cultists and Shrooms** 
We then leave to continue our journey to [[Heartbeat]] but are flagged down by a flumph, who tells us that there are [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane#Cult of Seed|Cultists of Seed]] nearby. We find one who is dying. 

We talk with the Cultist of [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]] and he asks if we are willing to submit ourselves to [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]]. I asked what that entails. He says that it requires faith. I offer to heal him in exchange for him to not be aggressive with our party. I heal him & [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Lorenzo]] talks about the similarities between him being a follower of [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bahamut]] and the Cultists following [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]].

The cultist says that [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Tanoq]] has [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]]'s eyes and holds an Amber Nucleus. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Dedera Free|Dedera]] asks him why he follows [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]] and the cultist says, "I achieved enlightenment and that why I follow him. He is the truth. If you saw the light, you would too. If you saw the glow." He describes the glow as "all around us. In his eyes (pointing to [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Tanoq]]) in the sky and in the water." He confirms that he can see traces of amber and that the more faith one has in [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]], the more of a vessel of [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]] you become and the more blessings he bestows on you. He says that amber is his power & his prison.

After helping heal him, he hands me a syringe with Amber Liquid and hands it to me. He says that it is all he has and that I can do with it as I please, although I can learn more about [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]] by going to the Section 12 Lab in Heartbeat. They can tell me more about the Amber Liquid.

He says that all he wants from me is to truly find faith and the amber glow of [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]].

He then pulls out another vial of orange liquid and downs it. This causes his body to morph. His arms and legs start to contort. He goes rigid & stiff, then black & orange bark-like figure start to come out of his body. Leaves sprout from it and his body is ripped open as a Treent makes its way out of him. The Treent grows into a giant monster and has spores from its back turn into 2 additional Treents. We enter combat with the creatures, but after a few interactions, we determine to run away. The Treents start to attack the flumphs and kill all but one of them.

[[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Tanoq]] sends off a few fireballs and defeats the larger of the Treents, causing all three of them to fall. He then cast _Spare the Dying_ and failed to save a dead/dying flumph.

[[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]] also summoned a Zombie-esque monster, and that caused problems with the party.

[[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Dedera Free|Dedera]] says that [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Azazel]] looks like Kreth with his _Form of Dread_. Eiden has something to do with this.
