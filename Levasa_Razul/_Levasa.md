# Map of Levasa
## Geography
On the top is a cold, yet thriving environment. It holds the Levasan Sea, home to a multitude of fish and other sea creatures that fishermen claim are larger than the whales spotted on the planet below. Surrounding the sea are the Ruined Forest and Anvil Mountains teeming with dangerous wildlife that has adapted to the low atmosphere. The small mountain cave village, Hotpot, seated in Mt. Ember, is its main reason the miners who live in the mountains survive. It's a source for hot springs in one of the coldest climates and most dangerous parts of Levasa. In the Ruined Forest lies the ruins of the ancient, mostly unpopulated, city of Tianor. 

The bottom of the continent is the largest city on Levasa, and also its seat of power, [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Windsend]]. The city hangs downwards, mounted to the bottom of the rock, shaded from the sun, receiving light from its reflection on the water below. Multiple spires extend towards the ocean, many of them unfinished connections to The Unknown Planet, and have come to be called seascrapers. Temporal Tower, the longest seascraper is home to the king of Levasa, an elf named Remi and sits on the farthest East side of the city. Platforms spread across the city, holding many residential districts and shopping districts, as well as the famous Mage’s Seascraper, The Mew. 

The inside core is home to many tunnels, small mining villages, underground beaches and channels of water that eventually spill out to the ocean. There is one city of importance on the inside, the mining hub of Levasa, Heartbeat Station. It’s said to be located at the very center of the continent, but nobody has checked those facts and contested them. Whether it is the center or not, it is at least figuratively, the heart of the continent, holding the biggest and most powerful mining resources that spread everywhere. It’s run by a group of merchants and scholars appointed by King Remi. Besides the necessities, it doesn’t hold many attractions unless you’re a miner in search of a paycheck, or a person with a less reputable career, in which case, this is the place for you. It’s the largest city geographically, home to The Miner’s Railroad with its web extending to every mining channel on the continent. (And every black market channel. Literally, it is home to a physical black market emporium. Or it is said to be.) 

The outside walls of the continent hold many waterfalls that spill into the air below, deep forests that hide in caves or decorate the sides of the rock, and some terraces where villages and wildlife dwell. There’s The Miner’s Railroad that runs all through the inside of Levasa, but the outside is home to the King’s Highway; a cliffside road that spreads all around the continent from [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Windsend]] to Hotpot, and every city in between. Because of the amount of work that goes into maintaining the road to keep it safe, it is usually slower than The Miner’s Railroad, but considerably safer, if you’re willing to pay the tolls. Many areas are notable, but the one universally notable area is the city, Gladiodor, a hub for casinos, athletic tournaments, guild strongholds and fighting pits. Your third travelling option would be ATLAS(Arranged Transport for Land, Air and Sea) Skyway’s airships, that can take you to any port on the rock, but this is the most expensive option. ATLAS also offers boating and carriage rides, through the Levasan sea channels and highways. 

There are many other features of Levasa you may have seen in your life, but no matter who you are, you know these things. 

Recap: 
- Bottom - [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Windsend]], Temporal Tower, The Mew, political seat of power 
- Middle Crust - Gladiodor, misc. villages, The King’s Highway(safe, but slow and taxed) 
- Middle Core - Heartbeat Station, misc. villages and mines, Black Market Emporium(maybe), The Miner’s Railroad(unsafe, but less expensive and faster) 
- Top - Levasan Sea, Ruined Forest, Tianor, Anvil Mountains, Mt. Ember, Hotpot Springs 
- Air - ATLAS Skyways(Most expensive travelling option)
# Levasa History
- Levasa was created by the gods, was populated as a second moon of The Unknown Planet, lifted into the sky by the benevolent or evil “god” found in the center of Levasa or is a suspended meteor, stopped by an ancient hero.(??? BW) 
- Earliest recorded history details the journey of three tribes all waking up on Levasa, each person with a case of amnesia. They knew nothing of their differences and could only remember their own names and who their families were. Three leaders among them stood up in leading and developing Tianor and Levasa.(354 BW) 
- Tianor expanded and Levasa started being mined for its resources.(354-344 BW) 
- Amber was discovered and was so abundant, it allowed all the people to take from it without causing much fighting or war(though this was held on a small scale, and crime still happened).(344 BW) 
- Levasa expanded on top and down into its core. This expansion was quick, as Amber helped speed up the process of mining. It only took 200 years to discover 100% of the rock.(151 BW) 
- Heartbeat Station was organically formed as a mining hub for the entire continent, as it contained the largest concentration of, not only amber, but many other valuable and useful resources as well.(102 BW) 
- Gladiodor was formed as a city that grew around a coliseum, staging Levasa’s first legal fighting tournaments. (90 BW) 
- [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Windsend]] was built as the only structure found on the bottom of the continent.(74 BW) | Almost overnight amber became scarce and started to react violently when used on anything other than ancient equipment. (4 BW) 
- Tianor and Gladiodor went to war over amber, the battle ending with Tianor’s king being killed in battle and all of its population either relocated or destroyed(4 BW- 1 WE) 
- [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Windsend]] expanded using minimal amber and became the seat of power, founded by an architect named Walden, said to be a resourceful and intelligent man. This ushered in a new era of safe amber use through the means of magic, instead.(1 WE) 
- Amber became outlawed, and expansion was slowed. Peaceful times were among Levasa, everyone afraid of what amber could do.(1 -140 WE) 
- At the age of 227(relatively young for an elf), Walden was assassinated by the first ever appearance of the Cult of [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane|Seed]].(140 WE) 
- Walden’s son was crowned as the new king and made amber’s use legal again.(141 WE) 
- Generally peaceful times again, despite the use of Amber, which was used in moderation and pockets of large amounts of it were discovered in Levasa’s core.(141 WE - 395 WE) 
- Overpopulation in cities started to become a problem, and options for exploring The Unknown Planet were beginning development.(395 WE) 
- The first Airship ever invented, by a man named Cid, became the talk of Levasa and after ten years a fleet of them were created. The King hired Cid to create LANDD(Levasan Air and Nautical Discovery Division) to make more. Finally, the Fleet’s flagship, named Walden’s Wing(ironically powered by Amber) was sent off to lead a group of hopeful young people to populate and colonize The Unknown Planet. The fleet carried approximately 20,000 passengers. After departure, they were never heard from again.(415 WE) 
- More airships with smaller crews were sent out over time, but none of them ever returned. Finally, the group LANDD gave up on colonization of The Unknown Planet and changed its name to ATLAS(Arranged Transportation for Land, Air and Sea). Instead, it created airways between external Levasan ports that made travel much faster, though is the most expensive travelling option.(425 WE) 
- With many people now flocking to small villages and parts of the wilderness, previously uninhabited, it cut down on the overpopulation problem and generated more jobs and checkpoints for roads. Outrage about the deaths of the people in LANDD’s fleet was starting to cause a cold war rebellion, with many family members becoming criminals or starting riots and battles in [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Windsend]] and Heartbeat Station.(426 WE) 
- These rebellions were met with no mercy and anyone who claimed to be part of a violent group of rebels, was executed. Many years went by before the group grew quiet and the king who ruled during these times, Walden’s son, Pierre, became hard and grim. He seemed to age twice as quickly as most elves do and died at the age of 672.(504 WE) 
- Pierre’s son, King Remi, came into power, ushering in a fair, but strict law. He created a tight leash on mages and the usage of amber, claiming the two brought greed into the hearts of the people. Those who studied magic or amber must be registered and carry a license to do so. With said license, mages were offered a state-of-the-art facility in [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Windsend]], known as the Mew, to practice their magic in, so long as they passed the proficiency test. If they did not, they were free to use whatever their own town might offer, but if magic was used unlawfully, or without a license, they were immediately imprisoned in the anti-magic prisons across Levasa. Those studying ambers were granted a home in Heartbeat Station, and facilities designed to contain amber and room for experiments.(506 WE) 
- Things stayed civil(mostly) for a long time. That is, until the assassination of King Remi’s Queen, Solacia.(1020 WE) 
- King Remi died in battle against his older brother Yves
- The throne is up for contest between [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Dedera Free|Dedera]] & Jean after Elliot took the place of Oko, helping keep Levasa from crashing into [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Sporos]]

## Pantheon
_Levasan Royal Gods(the King’s pantheon, also known as LRG)_
- [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bahamut]], The Platinum Dragon: Lawful good god of air and creation. 
- [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Chauntea]], The Soul of Levasa: Chaotic good goddess of progress and growth. 
- [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]], The Black Lord: Lawful evil god of hatred and corruption. 
- Asmodeus, The Ruler of Hell: Chaotic evil god of death and destruction. 

Other gods exist within this pantheon, but the lore teaches that at Levasa’s creation, AKA The War of the Gods, [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]] tricked all the other gods into surrendering their powers to him and losing their ability to rule, naming them The Silenced. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bahamut]], [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Chauntea]] and Asmodeus were the only three who didn’t fall for [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]]’s trick. They each approached [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]]. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bahamut]] and [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Chauntea]] combined their powers to defeat him and earn back the powers of the other gods, equally dispersing them among the four remaining gods. Asmodeus later agreed to a deal with [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]] in order to destroy [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bahamut]] and [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Chauntea]], but halfway through their war, when they saw they were losing, [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]] turned on Asmodeus, sealing him in Hell and agreed to stop attacking the good gods, in exchange the Asmodeus is dealt with and [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bane]] will keep his mischief to a minimum. They believe, during this war, [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Bahamut]] and [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Levasa_Razul/Chauntea]] might have created Levasa as a way to protect the people who might have been affected by it on The Unknown Planet. Their own scriptures do not prove this, however. 

_The One, True God of All(An uncommon, but recognized pantheon, its followers are called Lights)_
- This group of believers believe in one god who created all things, He is their ruler and goes by many names, but it most commonly referred to as Lord on High, or simply God. They believe he created the other “gods” as angels and demons, but not actual gods. This is a usually peaceful group that call themselves Lights, though its members’ views vary at times, due to worldly forces, or so they claim. They claim they don’t know why Levasa came to be, but whether it was an ancient hero or the LRG or whatever, God is the one who willed it. 

_Followers of The Hero(typically, people who are not educated in the official Levasan schools, or converted by Lights and who choose to believe only what they know for sure)_
- These people believe there are forces at work beyond them, but they have never seen it, so they can’t put their faith in that. They have seen many heroes rise up in history and current era, however, and decided that they’re the closest to gods they’ll ever get. These people all belong to the same group, but have an open minded view and may choose who is among their personal list of gods. 
- The most common heroes who are chosen are the three tribesman leaders from the beginning of Levasa’s history, Walden Free, the first King of Levasa and Gladiodor’s founder, Venge. Their list is as broad or thin as they wish it to be, however and many other notable figures often appear on it. These people usually believe Levasa is a moon.

## Recent Events & Rumors
Concerning Amber, the latest rumors are of illegal experimentation. Only a few weeks ago, in Granite, one of the mining villages near the top of Levasa, a half-elf woman named Alkaid Free, a daughter of King Remi’s youngest brother, went on a rampage, killing several residents of the village before running into the lord's office and exploding. Alkaid fit the description of Queen Solacia’s assassin and was most likely in hiding. The explosion caused a cave-in and nearly a quarter of the village was destroyed. Survivors are trying to rebuild and Remi has sent a group of soldiers from Hotpot to help repair. Even some of the mainly neutral monks from a monastery on Mt.Wing went down to help. WItnesses also report that a human man with a claymore and glowing eyes left the Lord’s house minutes before the explosion.

Other rumors of cultists appearing in the tunnels near Heartbeat say that a creature has been spotted with some of the cultists almost too large to fit in the caves. It leaves behind traces of faintly glowing orange drool. Some say the scouts sent to track the beast haven’t returned. The rumor has miners so afraid, they’re either petitioning the king to send Knight-Rangers to investigate or striking altogether.

Lastly, a child thought to have gone missing for a couple of years was found in the ruins of Tianor. A young orcish boy named Fin Buckets was found in the castle, physically unharmed, but couldn’t manage to speak any words other than “Boom.” Some of the people involved in finding Buckets claimed they saw land formation off in the distance of The Unknown Planet, heavily obscured by fog. No one else has seen it themselves, but the people remain firm in their statements. Buckets has been returned to his guardian in the small mining village of Limestone nearly two miles directly beneath the ruins.
