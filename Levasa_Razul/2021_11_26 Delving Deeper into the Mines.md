# Session 2: Delving into the Mines
## Recap
[[Tanoq]] knocked on the door, seeming like it was okay.
## Plot
On the door in front of us, hot oil comes from pots on top of the barrier. Through Speak w/ Dead, [[Azazel]] learns there are Thralls of [[Levasa_Ashe/Gods/Asmodeus|Asmodeus]] on ahead in the mine. Azrael's imp sees that there are hell hounds carrying dwarves somewhere. There is an abomination that can see the invisible imp, and it is growing. This growing abomination seems to be in charge of the creatures in the mine. 

Azazel manifested the the Abomination via Minor Illusion, saying that it seems to be feeding off the dwarves. Also, he thinks that they are transforming living creatures into thralls of Asmodeus. (Biomancer's Wet Dream). 

We destroyed the barrier with the Shield Guardian. [[Lyserah]] goes to hide from the demons. The barrier looks like it will collapse the ceiling, so [[Razul]] _webbed_ it to be secure. 

After taking a vote, we decided the best course of action is to take down the cavern, burying the creatures in the cavern. 

The creatures started attacking the group on the right path, while Tanoq & I went down the straight path. Tanoq sees unmarked, unopened crates in a room. He moved further back from the room and cast _Fireball_ centered on the room. The alcohol in the room ignited, causing an explosion in the room. I cast _Pulse Wave_, knocking out the remainder of the columns on the straight path. 

[[Ingrid_Epensen|Ingrid]] then began _Guiding Bolt_ the pillars, triggering a collapse of the right side of the cavern. She broke her ankle escaping the collapse.

After the cavern collapses, we take a rest. Azazel sends his familiar into the rubble to get confirmation. He sees all the creatures are dead except for the Abomination.

Some miners came to the mine to find that it was caved in (by us). I tell them that the miners that were in the mine died honorably. The dwarves tell us to go back to Gecko and walk out of the mine. 

Lyserah serves "The Cat" according to the abomination in the cave that was consuming the souls of the dwarves. 

Azazel tells us he has a coin on which contracts are made. If the other party breaks the contract, he gets their soul to ask questions to or heal himself. Lyserah is bound by this coin to be his Apprentice.
