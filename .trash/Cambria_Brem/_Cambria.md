No one reputable has seen a dragon in over 50 years
## Dragon War
Red & Blue Dragons: Red dragons are the bad dragons that lived down south. Blue dragons worked with people in [[Cinderdreath]] long ago.

Red Dragons exterminated all the Blue Dragons for helping humanity.

The world was terrorized by dragons that no one could control, but they have since been extinct.
