# Significance
Limsa is a medium sized harbor town at the southeastern part of the Cambrian Sea.

_It is where the story begins_

## #Dnd/Cambria/Session/2022_01_11 - Of Beast & Men
We met at the Hourglass Inn after having dealt with some Bandits that were impeding trade with [[Bastok]]. The barmaid gives us 40GB for 6 Amulets, which was distributed out evenly amongst present party members (10GP each). 

We ordered some beers, but they were quite awful, and when asked about it, the barmaid said that they were down to some shitty stuff because the good stuff had been used up and was out of supply due to some beastmen. The farm that provided the good stuff was out west. 

As we approach the farm in question, we notice that the crops were razed and there were hoof tracks (resembling horses) throughout the field. In the distance, there were some workers near the storage barn with barrels surrounding them. The workers inform us that the owner of the farm is in the house at the center and his name is Goldeen.

According to one farmhand, John, the beastmen were coming from the southern caves and started pillaging a few months ago. It started with some killings, but escalted to pillaging as recently as a few nights ago. "Furry Legs, big muscles _scary_" was his description. 

We head south and come across a path between rocks. As we approach, [[Brem|I]] see a few beastmen in a tent (seems to be a guard shack of sorts) and one that is walking around a fire with a wooden board stacked with food. [[Tomas Armand|Tom]] knocks out the one by the fire and one lounging in the tent with [[Unsorted/D&D/Resources/Spells#Sleep|Sleep]]. We then kill all four of the beastmen so that we can gain entry to the cave behind. (_Note: Beastmen use scimitars_)

As we enter the cave, we notice that there is a large central cavern with a small room on the left and pathway going forward. [[Brem|I]] go into the small room on the left and kill the 2 beastmen in there with the help of [[Draxeshkmak Brenziros|Drax]] and [[SkraSith|Skra]]. 

After clearing out the small room, we continue forward to see another small room, but this time housing an old bound man. [[Tomas Armand|Tom]] helps unbind him, gives him some water and he collapses on the ground.

At the end of the passageway, [[Tomas Armand|Tom]] sees a large beastman (appx 1.5x normal size) sitting on a stone throne with a greataxe, banging it rhymatically on the ground. He is the first we see wearing armor. After a few rough rounds of combat, we finally take him down.

## #Dnd/Cambria/Session/2022_01_18 - Casual B&B (Blacksmiths and Beastmen)
After defeating the large beastman, we look around his cave and see a pile of skeletons with their clothes nearby, and his throne with his emblem on it. 

After looking around, we went back to the small room with the old bound man and try to wake him up, but fail to do so, so we pick him up and carry him back to Goldeen's farm. 

Once there, Goldeen mentions that his name is Nost. He invites us into his home and we spend the night there. In the morning, Nost gives us thanks for saving him, and says that if we stop by a large blue rock that is between the farm and Limsa the next day, he'll give us a reward. 

We go back to Limsa and go shopping for new items. We visit a general goods store and the [[Limsa#Lockhardt Forge|Lockhardt Forge]], where we meet the magical battlesmith, [[Brigid Lockhardt|Brigid]]. After pleading with her father, [[Brigid Lockhardt|Brigid]]'s dad says that she can join us on our adventure, but makes us sign a contract (below)

```ad-note
title: Brigid Contract with Alric
collapse: open

What the Party gets now:
20% discount on everything in the Lockhardt Forge for everyone

What the Party gets after Brigid is happy:
500GP discount on plate armor for Drax
20000GP discount on a magical rapier for Brem

If Brigid dies, Alric will kill the Party. 
```

While waiting for the next day, we go back to the [[Limsa#Hourglass Inn|Hourglass Inn]] and drink until we need to sleep, then get into our rooms. Once in my room, [[Brem e'Tesh|I]] notice that there is a spider web of cracks in my blue rock.

When we wake up the next day, we go downstairs to find the morning shift (not Embra) working the bar, and he brings us breakfast. We start our journey to the blue rock that Nost described and as reach it, [[Draxeshkmak Brenziros|Drax]] thinks it is a good idea to punch it, but nothing happens. After a little bit, Nost arrives, dressed in a purple robe. [[SkraSith|Skra]] detects magic all around him, but isn't able to place what kind of magic it is. Nost makes us an off: a bag full of coin or an empty bag. We decide on the empty bag, and he hands us a bag of holding. [[SkraSith|Skra]] is the keeper of it. 

We then decided to go to Bastok so that Brigid can get her fill of adventure. On our way back to Limsa, we were attacked by a band of 9 beastmen and a large dog. We dispatched them with the combination of damage first, sleep, then slaughtering them. 

**LEVEL UP**

[[Brem e'Tesh|I]] feel rustling in my backpack and when I open it, I notice that my blue rock has hatched a baby blue dragon. Not sure what her name will be yet, but this is quite the surprise. 

## #Dnd/Cambria/Session/2022_01_25 - The Snaking Road
After coming back through Limsa on our way to [[Bastok]], [[Brigid Lockhardt|Brigid]] stopped by the gem store to see if she could get one valued at or above 100GP. As we approached, we found that the door was locked and it showed signs of abandonment. She really wanted to get inside, so she used her thieve's tools to break in. _(At this point, [[Brem e'Tesh|I]] went down to the [[Limsa#Lockhardt Forge|Lockhardt Forge]] and talked with Alric.)_ 

Once inside the gem store, they found that it was quite dusty. There were cases with a few small rings and necklaces in them, but they came across a large safe. Brigid couldn't open it, but [[Draxeshkmak Brenziros|Drax]] decided that he would try to force it open with his axe. As his axe connected with the safe, it let out a loud sound of metal on metal, but failed to penetrate the door. They look around a bit longer and decide that what is in the case will do, so they take the necklace and Brigid turned it into a homunculus and the rings are put into [[SkraSith|Skra]]'s _Bag of Holding_. 

As they are about to leave, they notice that there are 2 guards walking down the street. At about this time, I leave the [[Limsa#Lockhardt Forge|Lockhardt Forge]], so as I pass the house I give them a signal that they are clear to leave. 

Afterwards, we leave for [[Bastok]]. After 2 days of uneventful travel, we reach the mountain pass and find that a rock slide blocked the road. We decide to set up camp with the rocks to our back. While resting, a Yuan-Ti Malison came down from the mountain and attacked Skra. After dispatching it, Skra flies up and sees more cave-like holes in the side of the mountain, so I sever the Yuan-Ti's head and put it on my spear as a warning to the others.
