# Biography
Brem grew up in the small woods of [[Tayleth#Tesh|Tesh]] with his family. It was here that his father, Er-gesh, taught him all about archery and hunting while his mother, Lydia, taught him how to be stealthy. He had a natural inclination to be sneak due to his quiet nature, even pranking the other boys his age and his sister, Cata. During his youth, he came across a large blue rock that looked like an egg. He took it thinking it was pretty and it became a kind of good luck charm for himself. 

He knew when he grew up that he wanted to join a group of soldiers and fight to keep everyone safe, even if the larger monsters are no longer dominant. He joined the [[Tayleth#Tayleth Guard|Tayleth Guard]] and while he excelled at being their scout (even earning the nickname _The Shade_), he longed for a life of adventure and to fight the beasts of the wild. 

When given the opportunity, he left and became a wandering mercenary, performing odd-jobs here and there, whether they were taking out a wild animal or helping to rid a town of a few bandits. These travels led him to be in [[Limsa]].
