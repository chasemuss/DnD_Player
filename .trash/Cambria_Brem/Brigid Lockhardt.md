# Biography
Brigid Lockhardt lives with her family in [[Limsa]]. They run a Blacksmith shop in the merchant town and have been around for generations. They are locally known for their weapons and work they complete on repairing ships and fishing supplies as well. Brigid works at the [[Limsa#Lockhardt Forge|Lockhardt Forge]] under her father and mother. 

Alric Lockhardt, her father, does the forging and her mother, Signe Lockhardt, a high-elf, takes care of the business/bookkeeping and knows a little bit of magic. She has a brother, Viktor, who will inherit the family business. 

Brigid has used the skill sets she's learned from both parents to become a low-level artificer, and has been using her ability to imbue objects with magical properties to bring in more customers to the shop. 

Brigid is happy to help out her family, but would much rather leave the town and learn how to build bigger and better weapons and maybe someday run her own weapons and magical items business in a larger city.
