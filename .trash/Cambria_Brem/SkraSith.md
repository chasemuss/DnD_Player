# Biography
I come from the Town of Ariosa. My Family followed that of the Moon Goddess, and I followed them in the ways of the Moon Goddess except I didnt see her the same way they did. I saw another side of her. A trickery, playfulness, the fun side of her. I slowly began to gain the reputation of being a playful trickster but one trick was a little too far (I assume) because I embarrassed one of the higher up Priests. I wasnt sure what the consequence would be so I left and found my way to Strixhaven and enrolled in the Silverquill College, after completing my time there, Well thats were we are now.
