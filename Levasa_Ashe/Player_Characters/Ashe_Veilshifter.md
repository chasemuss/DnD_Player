# Backstory
Ashe came from the small town of Lazuli on the topside of Levasa. Born to the Cyrus Dragonspeaker, Ashe loved hearing the tales of his dad's adventures and the fantastic beings he would meet on his journeys. Cyrus would tell him tales of the mighty dragons that he felled and befriended, telling Ashe where he met them as well, promising to take him to visit them when Ashe turned 16. 

On Ashe's 16th birthday, Seed Cultists attacked his village and killed everyone while he and his brother were out hunting. They were gathering meat for their journey to the dragons. Returning to nothing but rubble, they were stunned, but found their father's gear from when he was an adventurer (Dragon Wing Longbow, Dragon-Touched Focus, Sun Blade & Serpent Scale Mail). They buried their family and swore vengeance on those that that did this. Not able to live up to their last name, they abandoned it, deciding to make their own when the time came. 

While on the way to Windsend, The Raven Queen, unbeknownst to Ashe and Therion, took interest in Ashe and guided him in such a way that they would make it to the city. This help manifested its way via weapons appearing when they were about to be caught by bandits and blending into the shadows in a preternatural way. 

When they got to Windsend, they found it difficult to find work, and soon fell on hard times. The brothers began to frequent the poorhouse of Windsend (First meeting with Ingrid) trying to get anything they could. Therion suddenly fell very ill, and Ashe begged the clerics working the poorhouse to help. They took the brothers to the temple of Chauntea, where a young cleric with aubrun hair tended to his brother and nursed him back to health. 

Once he regained his strength, they continued the search for work. One night, while sleeping on the streets, Arkos bullied them and said that they were useless. Only when they began to fight back did he mention that he could use such energy and offered them the community of the Gulls. Therion declined for them, but Ashe didn't agree. Ashe argued that they could make a living in The Gulls, especially with their abilities, but Therion told him that honor is more important than gold. 

Therion found work as leathersmith, using a persona named Alfyn. It didn't bring home a lot of gold, but did bring home enough for Therion to give them food on the table, and shelter over their heads. Feeling like he could make more money to raise thier standard of living, Ashe secretly reached out to Arkos, requesting to join The Gulls. He spun a story of an apprenticeship he had found to Therion so that his absences throughout the day and night were not questioned. After joining, Ashe did a few jobs for them, and saved his money, hoping to surprise Therion with enough to help get a better home. 

The Gulls never knew that Ashe was a changling since he used a persona named Oberron, so that his abilities stayed secret. 

Occasionally, he would go to the Silver Songbird, and one day a dwarven bard performing spun fantasic tales and Ashe was intrigued. 

As the days turned to months, the crimes he committed began to weigh on his conscious. The straw that broke the camel's back was when the Gulls told him to steal a cleric's staff of healing (Ingrid is the cleric here) so they could sell it on the black market. He used his abilties to easily find the target, only the realize that the cleric they wanted the staff from was the same cleric that had saved his brother, out giving food and medicine to the poor. He could not bring himself to complete his mission, since the church had helped him and his brother in the past before the Gulls, so in the dead of night before the heist, he went to Therion, and confessed his transgressions. He told Therion of The Gulls and that he had made a mistake by joining them. He wanted out, but was scared of retaliation. Therion asked him which persona he used and changed himself into Oberron, "Let me protect you. I'll take your place, but you have to leave Windsend. Go to Heartbeat and ask for Ophelia. She had family in our village and I've been in contact with her. Until I'm able to leave as well, stay there and stay out of trouble." They hugged for the last time, Ashe crying and asking for forgiveness. Therion sent him on his way, going out to the meeting spot and stealing the staff. Ashe took the gold he had saved and travelled the King's Road, making sure to follow his brother's orders. 

Once he got to Heartbeat, he met up with Ophelia, Therion's contact. Unknown to Therion, Ophelia is the leader of The Formless Brotherhood an organization of spies for hire. While there, she sent him on a mission, and upon completion, she bestowed him the code name Veilshifter. 

While he went about his duties for Ophelia, occasionally he would hear voices in his head, revealing secrets of the shadows and how to enhance his abilities magically. 

After some time, Ophelia revealed to him what she knew about the Razing of Lazuli. The Cult of Seed was behind the attack, but she doesn't know why. She tells him that won't fully initiate Ashe into the Formless Brotherhood due to how young he is, but that his skills are undoubtedly impressive for his age. If he can continue to keep tabs on Seed, perhaps she'll reconsider her decision. 

She tells him that she heard of a group that is currently in Heartbeat and has had confrontations with Seed before. She also mentions that the Future King is with them, and that if Ashe can join them, then maybe he can get closer to understanding Seed and their motives. Ashe sees this as an amazing opportunity for 3 of his goals:
1) He can impress Ophelia
2) He can enact revenge on Seed
3) Potentially help his brother out of The Gulls by having the Future King assist him in leaving.
