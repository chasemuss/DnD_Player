# Notes
- I go to my deathscape. While there END & BEGINNING visit me.

```ad-info
title: The Deathscape
END tells me that my story isn't finished and that I can't stay here. 
I ask about BEGINNING and see that it is on the floor and a similar looking harpy to END. I ask them about my thoughts on my future path and they say that I have a few more chapters left. They tell me that I have to rise. I rise up and give Set and Solumn each 1 HP. 
```

- [[Set]] prays to his god and requests them to save the party and slay [[Dalamar]], using the Spark of Divinity in the pool
- Dalamar teleports to the basement where the spark was, and I grapple him
- Dalamar casts Circle of Death, downing [[Azrael]], Solumn, and Set. 
- [[Wynfrid Wolke|Wynfrid]] shackles Dalamar and blinds him with the Sovereign Glue
- [[Lykin]] puts a Ring of Mind Shielding on him, preventing his soul from going back to his phylactery.
- Dalamar summons his tower with [[Xinzounux]] inside
- Xinzounux Power Word Kills [[Lily of the Field|Lily]]
- Xinzounux drops from Dalamar's Tower into the pool that we are all in
- Xinzounux takes [[Solumn]], lays him on top of the tree stump in the middle of the pool. 

A pillar of light from heaven shines on Solumn and grows to fully encapsulate him. The temple of ochena begins to shake. We hear a voice call from afar say, "We didn't think we'd do this again, but here we are" ([[Clay]]). Peering through a bigger hole in the temple, we see ourselves minus Solumn, [[Jack]], and Lily. We appear older, more confident and assured. Our futureselves tell us that we have to kill Solumn, so we begin to attack him.
