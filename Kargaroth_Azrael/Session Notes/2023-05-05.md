# Key Events
- I go to my deathscape and END visits me. 
 
![[Pasted image 20230505213207.jpg]]

END tells me that my story isn't finished and that I can't stay here. 
I ask about BEGINNING and see that it is on the floor and a similar looking harpy to END. I ask them about my thoughts on my future path and they say that I have a few more chapters left. They tell me that I have to rise. I rise up and give Set and Solumn each 1 HP.
