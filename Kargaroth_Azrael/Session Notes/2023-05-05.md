title: The Deathscape
END tells me that my story isn't finished and that I can't stay here. 
I ask about BEGINNING and see that it is on the floor and a similar looking harpy to END. I ask them about my thoughts on my future path and they say that I have a few more chapters left. They tell me that I have to rise. I rise up and give Set and Solumn each 1 HP. 
```

- [[Set]] prays to his god and requests them to save the party and slay [[Dalamar]], using the Spark of Divinity in the pool
- Dalamar teleports to the basement where the spark was, and I grapple him
- Dalamar casts Circle of Death, downing [[Azrael]], Solumn, and Set. 
- [[Wynfrid Wolke|Wynfrid]] shackles Dalamar and blinds him with the Sovereign Glue
- [[Lykin]] puts a Ring of Mind Shielding on him, preventing his soul from going back to his phylactery.
- [[Xinzounux]] power word kills [[Lily of the Field|Lily]]
