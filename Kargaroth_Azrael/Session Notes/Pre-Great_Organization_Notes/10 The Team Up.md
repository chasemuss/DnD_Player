We meet up in Silothgroth with the other party in Lava's shop. 

Lava says:
> In the moment of one's final hours, when faced with insurmountable evil, the way to combine them is revealed as the final chapter of one's life has started. #God/Aterna/Artifact/Beginning #God/Aterna/Artifact/End 

[[Wynfrid Wolke]] gives the puzzle box to [[Meridian]] who is unable to solve it, and then [[Jack]] picks it up and says he'll give it a shot.   

While talking, we learn that the [[The_Atlas_of_Creation|Book of True Names]] can break the Barrier to the Gods, so Jack casts _Legends Lore_ on the part that [[Meridian]] threw to the stream of time. 

> The Keeper's Tome - Lost to time when Meridian and Coriander were in a fight with Barnabas along with the Tome of Time (Omega). The Tome of Time has yet to return to the time stream. The Keeper's Tome is currently in Hell, and is currently in a master toy-maker's favorite box (infernal puzzle box that Wynfrid has?)

We spend time solving the puzzle box that Wynfrid put down, and find a key that leads to a demiplane. I push the door open and walk into a toymaker's workshop. The Toymaker asks who solved the puzzle, and Jack speaks up. The toymaker thinks that Jack is [[Xinzounux]]. Jack says he is here for the Keeper's Tome. The toymaker gives the puzzle box (and the demiplane workshop) to Jack. He also gives the book to Jack who gives the book to [[Meridian]]. 

Lykin makes a simulacrum of [[Lava]]. 

[[The Party/Clay]], [[The Party/Lykin]], and [[Wynfrid Wolke]] go to [[Lily of the Field]] and he gives them a tour of the temple, showing that the Spark of Divinity is the pool of [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Ochena, the Gentle|Ochena]] at the bottom of the temple. 

They find a variety of monsters and traps in the temple. At the top of the temple, they find a gold & silver tree. 

==Lily wants Dalamar's Helm== <-- Do we let him?
