# Key Events
- Combat continued

[[Jack]] banished the Deathguard. The Deathknight was destroyed as well. The Deathswarm of undead was destroyed. Lykin continued to work alongside [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/Unknown_Location/Characters/Dalamar]]. Dalamar learned that [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/The Party/Solumn]] is the vessel. Lily's speedy couriers will move [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/The Party/Azrael]], [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/The Party/Set]], & Solumn's bodies to the pool. We will find out if Solumn passively being in the pool will trigger the divinity spark.
