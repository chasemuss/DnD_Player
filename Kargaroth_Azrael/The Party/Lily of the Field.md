## Other Notes
### Contract to Join the Party:
This contract, agreement, and pact is, and shall be, enforceable within 24 hours, and through perpetuity, when the individual, Lily of the Fields heretofore and upon further notice, known as the "Party in the First Part" agrees to the terms by written, verbal, or physical consent. This agreement will confer to the individual, Kienvini Kogatesh, heretofore known as the "Party in the Second Part" the full faith and force required to collect, retrieve, take, or possess the agreed upon consideration for the transaction of goods as per The Charter to complete the consideration upon the agreement wherein the Party in the First Part will surrender the rights, title, and responsibility for the ineffable quality of person-hood, or "soul" to the Party in the Second Part should the Party in the First Part challenge, refuse, or break the rules herein listed within the contract to the Party in the Second Part, the Party in the First part will be interred, not by the fault of the Party in the Second Part, as the Party in the First Part is not in accordance with the agreement set forth by the two parties. This retrieval of 'soul' will be achieved by whatever means necissary in order to fulfuil the agreement.

The Party in the First Part agrees to only access the Tome known as the Necronomicon whilst in the presence of the Party in the Second Part or a person known as part of the adventuring party listed and known to currently include the following persons; Meridian, Azreal, Winfrid, Sol, Jack, Clay, Lykin, Set, The Party in the Second Part, and Cinder. He also agrees to not delete, alter, modify, or replace memories of the party during The Party in the First Part's attendance with the persons including The Party in the Second part. Once it is determined that The Party in the First Part can be trusted alone with the Tome he will then have full access and allowance to travel with, posses, use, copy, and/or do as he wishes with it on the condition that it is not used to harm The Party in the Second Part. During his stay with the afrementioned party the Party in the First Part is offered protection, housing, and general adventure assistance until that wherein the DemiGod known as Xinxounix is murdered, dispatched, turned 'good', or trapped in such a way that he can not reek havoc on this plane or any other. Should The Party in the First Part need to leave the company of the party of persons for any reason during the afrementioned time period, he may elect a person from the party to accompany him. If that person refuses, someone will be assigned to the position.
