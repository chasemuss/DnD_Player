# Basic Info
- Alignment: 

Her claimed reason for being a revenant is that she lost her husband to [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/Unknown_Location/Characters/Hadulus]]'s experiments. Her cadence while telling this is different than when she talked previously. It wouldn't be until many years later that the same illness takes her, but she vowed that she would stop Hadulus and take everything from him and burn him to the ground. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/Behind the Divide/Characters/Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]] gave her the chance to get her revenge and told her what Hadulus was after & wanted the most. [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/Behind the Divide/Characters/Cijun, the Defiler|Cijun]] promised that he would remake the word how he saw fit, but leave Hadulus for her. (As the story progresses, her cadence becomes more confident, like a "I won't give up until Hadulus dies")

She claims to be bound by her contract to make [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/Unknown_Location/Characters/Ylorb]] a completed vessel before Hadulus makes a vessel for [[Dungeons_and_Dragons/Player/Kargaroth_Azrael/Behind the Divide/Characters/Zicarae, the Torturer|Zicarae]]. Failure does not equal Death. Failure equals Oblivion.
