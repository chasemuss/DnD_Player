# Basic Info
- Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

Enjoys unpredictable Champions & Voices as they give the most entertainment

Typically not active, but recently has picked Solumn as both his Champion and Voice (one in each timeline.) Solumn is currently his voice.

Gilford says that he would most likely stand against Zicara, since he was instrumental in creating the _Great Divide_ and doesn't want her to be the only god on this side of the _Great Divide_ as it would eliminate a lot of possibilities.
