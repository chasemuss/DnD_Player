# Backstory
The only full god not a descendant of [[Chaos, the Infinite|Chaos]]. Boaos was born a mortal one of [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Nutari, the Hidden Moon|Naturi]]’s first Tabaxi created. He studied endlessly, and became the most knowledgeable mortal on the plane. With so much knowledge he pushed the world forward with it. He came to know the triplets of magic quite well. Together the four of them pushed magic to new heights, and depths. Tabaxi aren’t considerably long lived. Boaos knew his day were growing short, but could not let go of the world. His thirst for more knowledge lead him down dark paths. Boaos became the first necromancer. He found a way to preserve his life, denying death. [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Ochena, the Gentle|Ochena]], the goddess of life, and at the time death was slighted. Creation had only just begun and already a mortal had denied his return to her. [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Ochena, the Gentle|Ochena]] cursed Boaos with immortality. He would never find rest, there would never be peace. He would live on forever, as the collector of the dead. Many mortals are unaware of the story of Boaos. Though many still have temples to death. Generally considered nondenominational as all beings die regardless of race alignments or religion.  Some still attribute the domain of Death to [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Ochena, the Gentle|Ochena]], though she forced it upon Boaos.

He holds despite his curse a positive relationship with the twins, [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Solari, the White Moon|Solari]] and [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Nutari, the Hidden Moon|Nutari]], and their older sister, [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Fanera, the Book|Fanera]]. However, [[Behind the Divide/Characters/Ochena, the Gentle|Ochena]] will always hold resentment towards him. The other gods deny Boaos’ ascendance, and avoid engagement with him whenever possible.
