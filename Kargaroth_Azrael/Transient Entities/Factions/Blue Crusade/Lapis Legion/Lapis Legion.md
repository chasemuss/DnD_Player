# Description
A much smaller group mostly splintered off from the Cobalt Cascade but still very militant. They primarily occupy an area, keep the officials in place but restructure the government of the town they’ve just claimed in order to “peacefully” create a paradise here alongside the current world.

## Goals
- Solve disputes diplomatically
- Illuminati-esque world take over via legislature

# Members
Leader: [[Transient Entities/Factions/Blue Crusade/Lapis Legion/Members/Lucarian]]
